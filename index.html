                        <p class="sub-heading">HTML & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</p>

                        <p>To complete this project, I had to familiarize myself with HTML coding structure best practices. As the elements for each section create containers within containers to build the layout for the contents within. Making the best practice to code a webpage from the outside in as well as coding the webpage from top to bottom.</p>

                        <p>I also included the use of other developer tools such as using the browser’s development tools aka DevTools to test fragments of code to see live alteration to my webpage before implementing any changes. Another useful tool offered through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is code validating for my HTML and CSS, which is very helpful in troubleshooting any coding discrepancies.</p>

                        <p class="sub-heading">HTML5 & CSS Website Layouts</p>

                        <p>This project introduced me to developer tools needed to recreate website layouts. Here I learned about Photoshop Design Comps and how important comps are to developers in retrieving vital information to reconstruct a website's layout. Photoshop tools such as guidelines to section off column widths for uniformity, extracting images and icons, and the ruler tool to find the distance between elements.</p>

                        <p>Using a design comp gave me the ability to recreate text information, such as font styles, sizes, line spacing, and color by accessing the character panel. Whereas the eyedropper tool helped me to retrieve hex color values for color scheme precision.</p>

                        <p>As an add-on to this project, I also had to demonstrate my ability to alter a single-page layout into a multi-page layout. By adjusting elements of the HTML code, so I could access additional folders and .html webpages designed to support a multi-page website arrangement.</p>

                        <p class="sub-heading">HTML5 & CSS Exercise</p>

                        <p>Each project creates its own distinctive structural design even though the coding elements are essentially the same. With this project, repetition of the recipe cards layout establishes uniformity while the contents of each card offer visual dissimilarity.</p>

                        <p>I found that following basic coding principles comes in handy to break contents and coding elements into organized, easy-to-read sections by using coding comments. While comments are for human use only, comments help to explain my code to my future self and others.</p>

                        <p>Comments also aid in adding visual white space to my code while highlighting major section changes and separating similar content into individual groupings for a cleaner more organized, reader-friendly appearance. Although this project used my knowledge of working with a design comp, text editor, DevTools, and validating my code, I also made sure to organize my HTML and CSS code into tidy easy-to-read sections using best practice formatting.</p>

                        <p>Hi, my name is Thea. About now, I bet you're asking yourself, how is this Web Developer any different from the millions of other Web Developers out there?</p>

                        <p> To this day, this remains one of the more difficult questions for me to answer. Like you, I have spent my life searching for that one special thing that will set me apart from everyone else. I am highly detailed-oriented with above average critical thinking skills. I organize my code for higher readability, which also leads to quicker problem-solving resolutions.</p>

                        <p>I'm fascinated with the idea of creating memorable sites that will inspire others both visually and verbally. Though through all this, one thing remains certain in everything I do. My main joy comes from assisting others in expressing their inner-most thoughts through a collaboration of minds.</p>

                        <p>Although I’m just starting out on one of my most exciting adventures to-date as a Web Developer, the road ahead still holds many mysteries. And, given the diversity of the field, I will continue to hone my skillsets while aspiring to new heights.</p>
